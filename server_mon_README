server_mon.sh is a script that should be hooked into your crontab file.  The script get's run periodically and runs a grep
on the output of 'supervisorctl status'.  If it looks like the service is up and running, a pid file is 'touch'ed in a specific
location.

Point pingdom to the globally hosted pid file.  If the pid file disappears (which it will if the script decides the service is not
running), Pingdom will cry bloody murder and you'll be the first to know.

Tips:
cp this script to the folder of your choice and edit it to your liking (modify the service string to look for, PID location, etc)
then do a symlink to /usr/bin such that it is easily available to everyone.
Then 
sudo crontab -e
 To run the script every minute use
* * * * * /usr/bin/my_server_mon_instance > /dev/null
in your crontab file
